# MinicraftJS
A remake of Minicraft made completely in the Construct game engine.<br>
See the releases page for Windows and Linux builds, as well as the .c3p file if anyone is interested in modifying it.<br>
Includes world creation and saving; an object damage and resource collection system; inventory and crafting; tools, weapons, enemies, and bosses; and multiplayer.<br>
Mobile & Gamepad support is coming soon.<br>
This is a solo project I work on in my free time, so don't expect immediate fixes and feedback. Updates will usually come on weekends.
